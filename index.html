      <p>Utah is a western U.S. state known for its stunning natural landscapes, including red rock formations, mountains, deserts, and five national parks—Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion. The state was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 19th century and remains the center of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Utah has a diverse economy driven by technology, mining, tourism, and outdoor recreation. Its capital and largest city, Salt Lake City, hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics and is a hub for skiing, culture, and commerce.</p>
